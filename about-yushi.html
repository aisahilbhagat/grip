                        <!-- Add your team's origin story here -->
                        So about this project i got this idea a few weeks later after my friend left our school and went to Karnataka and joined a military school. So well he did told me we will meet in winter vacation which is a long time for sure means he during summer vacation. So as he is there their is no option to talk to him means he is total cutoff from the outer world means not that much also means he could talk to family using phone they gave means but limited for sure okay and a computer lab with internet. Now he can talk to us with the internet in the computer lab but the things is in order to talk with us he would need a phone number to login whatsapp, telegram or any other platform . He could use instagram but let's be honest instagram could be blocked in the military school or it might not a good idea to use it their. Now after that only I got this idea why not I make a platform for my friends only to talk. In this only us no risk just login credentials I give him and start taking. Simple. So from that day I started to build it. Well the initial plan was just to make a normal chatting app for few of my friends but as i started to build it i thought I should make it for atleast 1000 users. So now here is what I deliver to you
